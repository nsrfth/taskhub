// NEW PERMISSION CHECKLIST (read before adding):
//   1. Add the string to `PERMISSIONS` below.
//   2. Add it to `PERMISSION_GROUPS` so the matrix UI renders it under the
//      right header.
//   3. Add it to the default `Manager` system-role permission list in the
//      seed + migration so existing teams keep working.
//   4. Decide whether it should appear in the default `Member` list (be
//      conservative).
//   5. Refactor the call site to use requirePermission(...) or hasPermission(...).
//   6. Add a test that covers (a) granted, (b) revoked, (c) admin bypass.
